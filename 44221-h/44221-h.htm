      THE REVOLT
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE.&mdash;<i>The Class-room. A table. Chairs arranged in semi-circle;
      an easy chair for Grandma Gregg. Screen in one corner. Chairs or couch
      upon which to lay wraps and hats. Otherwise an ordinary room. Tea things
      on the table.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      (PAULINE, <i>center of stage, with pail, broom, dusting rag, scrubbing
      brushes and mop, is discovered on hands and knees scrubbing. As curtain
      rises she rises to her knees, throws scrubbing brush and soap into the
      pail, gets up with difficulty and mops the floor. She is singing.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (singing) "All alone, all alone, nobody here but me. All alone,
      all alone, nobody here but me, All alone, all&mdash;" (<i>she stops
      mopping and leans on the mop handle</i>) Here it is now two weeks I've
      been workin' out my tuition in this Academy of Household Science for Young
      Ladies, and 'tis nothin' but scrub, scrub, mop, mop, sweep, sweep, from
      mornin' 'til night! I see plenty of work, but none of that tuition has
      come my way yet "Wanted," says the advertisement, "a young lady to work
      out her tuition in an academy." It says that, "Grandma Gregg's Flushing
      Academy of Household Science," it says, "fits the young ladies for to
      occupy properly their positions at the heads of their homes," it says, "It
      will be a fine thing for you, Pauline," I says, "to be tuitioned in an
      Academy," so I come, (<i>mops</i>) "We'll begin your lessons right away,"
      says Grandma Gregg, "take th' scrub brush an' a pail of water an' some
      soap an' scrub th' cellar." I've been scrubbin' ever since. I don't care
      much for the higher education when there is so much scrub in it. (<i>mops</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      (GRANDMA GREGG <i>enters</i>. PAULINE, <i>not seeing her, goes to table
      and examines tea things, books, etc.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA GREGG. Pauline!
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>beginning to mop hastily</i>) Yes'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Don't forget your curtsey, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>making a curtsey</i>) Good mornin', Grandma Gregg. I hope I
      see you well to-day. (<i>changing her tone</i>) If it ain't askin' too
      much, mam, when does my tuitioning begin? I've been scrubbin' for two
      weeks now, from mornin' 'til night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Have you scrubbed the cellar, Pauline?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Don't forget your curtsey, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>curtseying</i>) No'm. (<i>curtsey</i>) Yes'm. (<i>curtsey</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. You have scrubbed the cellar?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE (<i>curtseying</i>) Yes'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. And the garret? And the first floor? And the second floor?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (<i>curtseying</i>) Yes'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Very good, very good, Pauline. Then, when you have finished
      scrubbing this class room, you may scrub the front porch and the stable.
      Then it will be time to scrub the cellar again. You are doing very nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm, thank you, mam. (<i>curtsey</i>) But I was thinkin', mam,
      maybe I could have a little more tuition, and a little less work. "Work
      and tuition" was what the advertisement said, mam, an' I've seen nothin'
      but the work yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. My dear child! My dear, sweet child! I don't understand you. You
      have done no work yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>looking at her dress and at pail and mop</i>) I've done no
      work? I wonder, now, what I have been doin'!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>placidly</i>) You have been receiving your tuition. In this
      academy the study of Household Science begins with the rudiments.
      Scrubbing is one of the rudiments. As a new scholar you begin with the
      rudiments, of course. And I must say you are doing very well. You are
      making excellent progress. Apply yourself earnestly to your lessons and in
      a short time you will be promoted to another class. (PAULINE <i>stands
      with her mouth open as</i> GRANDMA <i>talks. She seems to be stunned</i>)
      Let me see you scrub, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>dropping on her knees and taking brush from pail</i>) Yes'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Don't forget your curtsey, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>curtseying on her knees</i>) No'm (curtsey. She scrubs)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Very good indeed! Very good indeed! You are progressing, Pauline!
      You are progressing. Apply yourself faithfully to your lessons. You may
      study awhile on the front porch now. And don't be afraid to use your
      muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>gathers up her pail and mop, etc. At door she turns</i>) Good
      morning, Grandma Gregg. (<i>curtseys</i>) (<i>aside</i>) Rudiment, is it?
      If I haven't done any work yet, I wonder now what the work will be like.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>has dropped into her chair and taken up her knitting</i>)
      Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Did you curtsey, Pauline?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. No'm. (curtseys) But I will, (<i>curtseys</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Pauline, have the new Professors come yet? I have hired two new
      Professors. A Professor of Husbandology, and a Professor of Rudiments.
      They are very highly recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Beg pardon mam, but what's Husbandology?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Husbandology is the Science of the Proper Treatment of Husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. And I know what Rudiments is. It's scrubbin'. No, mam, nothin'
      like them has come yet. "All alone. All alone&mdash;" (<i>sings</i>) (<i>exit</i>
      PAULINE)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA, (knits) Dear me! Dear me! I thought when I started this Academy
      the girls would flock to it most eagerly. When I was a young girl my
      mother would have been glad to have an academy like this for me to attend.
      I don't know what the world is coming to. Suffragists and Suffragettes,
      and Suffrage&mdash;this and Suffrage&mdash;that! If this academy wasn't
      sustained by the Anti-suffrage League it would have to close its doors. (<i>sees
      a book on table, takes it in hand</i>) "Woman and Her Rights." (<i>with
      disgust</i>) Augh! Who brought that here? (<i>throws it on floor</i>) I
      declare, I believe this is the last stronghold of the old-fashioned
      home-loving woman. I teach the girls to be good wives, (<i>door bell rings</i>)
      (<i>enter</i> PAULINE)
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (<i>curtseys</i>) If you please, mam, there's a female at the
      door says she is the new Professor of Husbandology. It's Susan Jane Jones,
      mam.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Show her in, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Don't forget your curtsey, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. No'm. (<i>curtseys</i>) (<i>exit</i> PAULINE)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. I hope Susan Jane Jones will be a real nice lady. There's nothing
      in the world more necessary than lessons on the Proper Treatment of
      Husbands. Women don't seem to know how to treat husbands now-a-days. They
      neglect 'em, the poor things. When I was a girl&mdash;(<i>enter</i> Susan
      Jane Jones.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. (<i>strides into room with umbrella held by middle and hand bag
      under one atm. Slaps them on table, and begins pulling off her gloves</i>)
      Well, here I am&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>mildly</i>) Don't forget your curtsey, Miss Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. (surprised) Hey? What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>gently</i>) All the faculty and students curtsey when they
      come into my presence, Miss Jones. It is a sweet old-fashioned custom&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. (<i>briskly</i>) Well, I'll soon change that&mdash;I mean, Howdy!
      Howdy! (<i>bobs several times</i>) (<i>aside</i>) I must not forget I am
      here as a spy in the enemy's country. If you are going to do the Romans
      you must do as the Romans do. (to GRANDMA) Swell joint you've got here,
      old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA, (<i>rubbing knees</i>) Swell joints? Yes, my dear, a little
      rheumatiz makes the joints swell. But I don't complain. I'm an old lady. I
      have to expect some aches and pains at my time of life. I'm thankful I can
      do a little good work in the world. Do you understand What your duties
      will be?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Sure Mike! I'm the Husbandology lady. I teach the girls how to
      treat their husbands when they get 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Just so. You will lecture on How to Coddle and Pet a Husband.
      Five lectures. Then you will give five lectures on Smoothing the Lines of
    </p>
    <p>
      Care from Hubby's Brow. Then&mdash;of course you show by example how all
      this is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. By example? You don't have a man here, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. We use the practical method in our classes. "Practice makes
      perfect," you know, (<i>calls</i>) Pauline!
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (<i>off stage</i>) Yes'm, I'm comin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA, (<i>calling</i>) Bring me the Ideal Husband, Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm. In a minute, mam.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter</i> PAULINE <i>with the Dummy Husband under her arm. She throws
      it into a chair. Exit.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. There! That is our Ideal Husband. He is all a husband should be.
      He does not drink nor smoke. He does not go to the club at night. He never
      says an unkind word. And he is happy. Do you know why?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Go ahead. I'll be the goat. What's the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. He is happy because we are kind to him. Because we coddle and pet
      him. I think, before I finally engage you, Miss Jones, I would like to see
      an example of your method of coddling and petting.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SUSAN <i>looks at the dummy thoughtfully, takes a step toward it and
      pauses, another step, and so on. Finally she jerks the dummy from the
      chair by the head and lays the head on her shoulder.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Poor hubby, does his poor head ache? (<i>pats dummy</i>) Was he out
      so late last night? (<i>puts dummy gently in chair</i>) Let little wifey
      rub his poor head, (<i>does so</i>) What did hubby say? All right, little
      wifey will tie a nice cold cloth around poor hubby's head. (does this)
      Now, kiss little wifey. (<i>kisses dummy</i>) What did hubby say?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. What did he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. He said "For goodness sake get away from here and leave me alone.
      Can't you see I'm a sick man? Get out of here and stop bothering me."
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA, (<i>admiringly</i>) How like a real man! And what do you do next?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. (<i>looking around</i>) I get a pillow. (<i>gets one from couch and
      puts it lade of dummy</i>) And I wrap up his feet (<i>does it</i>) There,
      poor dear. He's sleeping now.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Very good. You will do very well. Remember to teach that wives
      should obey their husbands and be kind to them. Husbands are such tender
      creatures. We should love them and obey them. I will see that your room is
      in order. No doubt you will wish to practise coddling the Ideal Husband a
      little longer before your classes begin. (<i>exit</i> GRANDMA)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN, (<i>alone</i>) Get off that chair, you big brute! (<i>jerks dummy
      of chair</i>) Come home intoxicated, will you? (<i>throws dummy back on
      chair</i>) Don't talk back to me! (<i>takes up dummy again</i>) You are
      going out, are you? Well, go out! (<i>walks toward screen with dummy</i>)
      Out you go! I'll stand no nonsense, I tell you! (<i>throws dummy behind
      screen</i>) Go, if you want to! There! Coddle and pet them! That's how I
      coddle and pet them! (<i>looks around</i>) This is a nice situation for
      Susan Jane Jones, Captain of Company A, First Regiment, Militant
      Suffragettes! But all is fair in Love and Votes for Women! This academy is
      the last stronghold of the old-fashioned woman, and from in it the tender
      young girls learn the vicious habits of keeping house, being good
      housewives and attending to their own affairs as their grandmothers did.
      From this root anti-suffragism might spread over the whole world, and I
      have crept in, like a spy, to corrupt and destroy it. Woman must and will
      rule! (<i>enter</i> KATE <i>pouting</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. (<i>not seeing</i> SUSAN) I don't care! I don't care one bit! I'm
      never, never going to speak to John Mason again as long as I live. I think
      he is just too horrid for anything, (<i>takes off coat and hat and throws
      them on sofa</i>) I just hate him. I hate every boy that ever lived, I do!
      I think they are mean, overbearing, egotistical things. (<i>wipes her eyes</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. (<i>clapping her hands once</i>) My sentiments exactly! I so
      consider all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. (<i>startled</i>) Oh! I did not know anyone was here. Good morning!
      (<i>curtseys</i>) Please, you won't tell Grandma Gregg what I said, will
      you? (<i>with head on one side</i>) She wouldn't like it. (<i>picking at
      her fingers</i>) She says females should admire and worship all males.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Humph! Fiddlesticks! Absolutely exploded theory. Latest theory is,
      females should abhor and despise all males. What's a man? He's a worm. A
      poor silly worm. Now, here! (<i>takes</i> KATE <i>by arm and leads her
      across stage</i>) We understand each other. You have felt the cruel
      oppression of a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. I&mdash;I&mdash;I just think John Mason treated me real mean,
      anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Woman, how else do men ever treat us? We are slaves. But we must be
      free. You think I am the new Professor of Husbandology, don't you? You
      think I am here to teach you how to treat husbands, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. I did think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN, (<i>threateningly</i>) Oh, I'll teach you how to treat husbands!
      (PAULINE <i>enters and overhears, unseen. She gradually comes closer to
      them</i>) I'll teach you how to treat all men. For ages man has crushed us
      under his cruel heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Has he?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. But we will trample him under foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Will we?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. We must throttle him. We must crush him.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Must we?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Pooh! He's a worm. We will do without him. We will drive him from
      the land. Absolutely. Man is a by-gone institution. I class him with the
      stage coach and the dodo bird. Woman can do his work better than he can.
      He must be driven from the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. But, now, mam, if he's driven from the land, he'll be taking a
      death of cold in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. So much the better. The object that should burn in every true
      woman's heart is the utter extermination of man. (<i>to</i> KATE) You have
      felt a man's cruelty. (KATE <i>wipes her eyes</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. I don't see why boys have to be so mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. And you, too, you poor creature. Have you not felt the heel of the
      oppressor?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Heel of the oppressor? Mercy sakes! That reminds me. Grandma
      Gregg sent me for to get the Ideal Husband and take him down cellar and
      black his shoes for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN, (<i>triumphantly</i>) You see! Man makes slaves of us all!
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Has any of you seen the Ideal Husband? Grandma Gregg said he was
      in the Classroom conversin' with the new Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. (<i>carelessly</i>) Oh, he's gone to his club. I mean, look behind
      the screen.

    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. My child, the time for the great revolution is at hand. Woman is
      about to take her rightfully supreme place in the world. In me you see one
      of the leaders of the Militant Suffragettes. Can I count on you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. I don't know. I think John Mason treated me just too mean&mdash;Oh!
      here Comes Grandma Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Hush. Not a word of this! (<i>in a changed tone</i>). Yes, my dear,

    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Very good&mdash;The stitches are a little too large, sweetheart&mdash;
      This buttonhole might be a little neater, precious, etc. (<i>girls take

      GRACE. Yes, Grandma Gregg. (<i>curtseys, and makes tea</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Now, young ladies, will you repeat the Golden Text for the day?

      ALL. "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach."

    <p>

      GRANDMA. Correct. IDA, if you had a husband and he came home very late,
      what would you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. (<i>curtseys</i>) I would pretend to be fast, fast asleep.

      You may take the class now, Miss Jones, and give it instruction in the

    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. My dear child, you should not handle a husband in that manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. I'll not be handling that husband in any manner very long, mam.
      I'm going to quit my job. Nothing but scrub, scrub, mop, mop, from morning
      to night. Look at them young ladies, a drinkin' tea and me doin' the scrub
      work. I'm tired of being scholar, I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>after reading telegram</i>) You are tired of being a scholar,
      are you, PAULINE?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm. I'm sick of it. I've learned this scrubbin' lesson from
      the cellar up.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. So you have, dear, so you have! You do it very well. And I am
      going to reward you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>happily</i>) Reward me, mam?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Yes. I have just received word my newly engaged Professor of
      Rudimentary Household Science cannot come. How would you like to be a
      professor, Pauline?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Oh, me a professor, mam! Me, who has nothing but rags to my name,
      a professor?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Yes, Pauline. I have made up my mind. I am going to make you my
      Professor of Rudiments. Young ladies, this is our new Professor of
      Rudiments, (<i>all curtsey</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (<i>wiping her eyes</i>) I feel like I ought to make a speech,
      mam, but I can't, I'm that overcome. I don't feel like I could do justice
      to the job, mam.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Oh, yes you can, my dear. Now, your duties as Professor of
      Rudiments will consist in teaching the young ladies scrubbing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Scrubbin'?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Yes, scrubbing, and mopping, and blacking stoves.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Scrubbin' an' moppin' an' blackin' stoves?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Just so. And you will teach by example. The young ladies will
      study your methods. You will scrub and mop and black stoves, and they will
      watch you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. I'll scrub and mop and&mdash;It's mighty like the job of bein'
      scholar, ain't it, mam? What pay do I get, mam, for all this scrub and
      mop?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Pay? I am surprised you should ask for pay when I have given you
      such a position of trust and honor. But there. If you must have pay, you
      shall have it. I will give you the work you owe me for the tuition you
      have received.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (puzzled) Yes'm. Thank you, mam. Now, now, do you do that work I
      owe you, or do I do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. What a question! You do it, of course. You owe it to me, child,
      don't you? (PAULINE <i>stands puzzled</i>) Now, young ladies, I will leave
      you to your two new Professors, (<i>exit</i> GRANDMA)

    <p>
      PAULINE. Get to work, you husband, get to work! (<i> goes to tea table and
      eats and drinks during the following scene</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Fellow females! (<i>the girls ignore her. They chatter loudly with
      one another. Finally</i> KATE's <i>voice is heard</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Well, I'll never speak to John again as long as I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. Well, he can't be a bit worse than Arthur. Oh, I'm so mad at
      Arthur. I was so mad I could have slapped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. What did he do, Grace?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. I met him on Main Street, quite by chance, you know, and he said,
      "Hello, GRACE, you don't want an ice cream soda, do you?" And I said, "Oh,
      I don't care." And he said, "Oh, well, if you don't care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. The <i>horrid</i> thing. I think boys are just too horrid for
      anything. I oo-ooed at George to-day, and he didn't OO-OO back at me at
      all. I'm through with George!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. Imagine! When I Oo-oo at a boy and he doesn't OO-OO back I consider
      it a deadly insult. I suppose he was talking to some other girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. No, he wasn't! He was riding his motor cycle, and he was only two
      blocks away&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. Perhaps he didn't hear you.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. That's no excuse at all. When a girl oo-oos it is a boy's duty to
      hear. I always hear when George oo-oos.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. Certainly! Any gentleman would OO-OO back at a girl if she oo-ooed at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. I suppose you mean Henry would OO-OO back at you. You and Henry!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. Thank you, but I don't speak to Henry any more. I've sent <i>him</i>
      about his business! I was going over to the tennis court yesterday, and I
      oo-ooed at him, and he said, "Where are you going, MAY?" and I said, "I'm
      going to play tennis, if I can find a partner." And what do you think <i>he</i>
      said?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. What did he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. He said, "Well, I'm sorry I can't go with, you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All. Oh, how horrid!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. Well, I've had all of <i>Sam</i> I want! When I got home from
      school yesterday I sat on the front porch <i>all</i> afternoon. Of course
      I expected Sam would happen to pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Of course. Any gentleman <i>would</i> happen, to pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. Certainly. And there I sat. And sat. And sat. And no Sam came by.
      Oh, I was mad. And what do you think his excuse was? His mother had fallen
      down the cellar stairs and broken her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. And he let that keep him home! Girls, I think the way the boys treat
      us is perfectly outrageous! There are whole minutes in every day when they
      don't think of us at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. Oh, not <i>whole</i> minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Well, parts of minutes, anyway. I understand that several times this
      term several of the boys almost knew their lessons. That couldn't happen
      if they thought of us <i>all</i> the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All. The horrid things!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Well, for my part, I'm through with boys! I wish they were all&mdash;all
      extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN, (<i>rapping on table with her umbrella</i>) Ladies! Fellow females!
      I have heard what you said. Your wrongs are enormous, but what does man
      live for but to oppress us? We are down-trod, down-trod by man, that worm
      that like a roaring lion seeks to cast dust in our eyes with his soaring
      wings while he rends our heart with his cruel beak! Shall we, ladies, be
      slaves to a worm?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. No, mam. (<i>curtseys</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. No! You wish the men were extinct. We will extinguish them. Why
      waste your lives here doing plain and fancy sewing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. And scrubbin'&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. When woman was meant to occupy the noblest spheres? Wives? Faugh!
      Housewives? Faugh! Let us take the work of the men, and do it! Follow the
      bright banner of Susan Jane Jones, the Militant Suffragette, and drive the
      men into the sea! I have heard the story of your wrongs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Well, I do think Henry was just too mean for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Sewing! Scrubbing! Have you women never wished to do the work of
      men?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Yes, I have. I always wanted to be a doctor, but my father wouldn't
      hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. What kind of a doctor, Kate?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Oh, a handsome doctor with curly gray hair. And you, Grace?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. Oh, I want to be a lawyer, a plump, jolly lawyer. And you, Edith?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. I want to be an editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. Republican or Democrat?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. I don't know. The kind with a big automobile. And you, Ida?
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. I want to be a politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mat. An honest one, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. Well, no. A successful politician. And you, May?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mat. I want to run a vegetable market, where the women can come with their
      market baskets.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Where the <i>men</i> can come with their market baskets, (<i>to</i>
      PAULINE) And you, you poor creature, have you never felt the longing to
      usurp man's sphere? Have you never longed to do a man's work?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Oh, yes, mam. This humble heart (<i>tapping her waist</i>) has
      felt the what-you-call it many a time. I have always wished, mam, to be a
      pirate.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      PAULINE. No more scrubbin'. (<i>throws away mop and brush</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. No more rag bags! (<i>takes rag bag from chair, and is about to
      throw it, when red rags fall out</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Hold on, Miss GRACE! Pirates is mostly dressed out of rag bags, (<i>winds
      red rag around</i> GRACE's <i>head, and a red rag as sash. All do likewise</i>)
      Wait till I get the swords, (<i>exit</i> PAULINE)
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE, (<i>front, with clenched fists</i>) OO&mdash;I feel blood-thirsty!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. And you look extremely blood-thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE, OO&mdash;I feel ferocious!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. And you look too ferocious for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. OO&mdash;I feel wicked!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. You are certainly a fear-compelling sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDA. OO&mdash;I feel murderous!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. You look like a most criminal character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mat. OO&mdash;I feel dangerous!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. You look extremely dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. (<i>entering with table knives, etc</i>.) OO&mdash;I feel like if
      I seen a cake of soap I could kick it! (<i>she distributes knives</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Reserve your wrath for the men. (<i>drawing them all to her</i>)
      Hist! To-night&mdash;at dead of night&mdash;we will capture&mdash;a lumber
      schooner&mdash;at Copp's lumber yard&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      All. Aye! Aye! Mam!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. To-night&mdash;at dead of night&mdash;meet me&mdash;at the corner
      of&mdash;Main and Broadway!
    </p>
    <p>
      All. Aye! Aye! Mam!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. To-night&mdash;at dead of night&mdash;we will strangle the watchmen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. At dead of night? I don't think we ought to strangle watchmen at
      dead of night unless we have a chaperone, do you girls?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Nonsense! What kind of Suffragettes are you to need a chaperone? I
      don't have a chaperone.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. Well, I don't care! I'm not going out strangling at night without a
      chaperone! It isn't proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. But you are a pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH. I don't care if we are pirates. We don't have to be improper
      pirates. I want to strangle and murder in a perfectly proper manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. How about takin' the old lady with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. Grandma Gregg? Why, she's no Suffragette. Oh, girls! The very thing!
      We <i>will</i> take Grandma Gregg! We'll capture her! We'll take her, in
      chains!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Excellent! <i>You</i> will have your chaperone, and I will be rid
      of the most dangerous Anti-suffra-gette! Seek her and seize her!
    </p>
    <p>
      All. We go! We go! (<i>exit all, left, except</i> PAULINE) (<i>enter</i>
      GRANDMA GREGG, <i>right</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. I thought I heard a noise, Pauline. How are the dear girls
      getting on with their lessons?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (<i>curtseys</i>) Fine, mam. They're learning new tricks every
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>picking up dummy and laying it over chair back</i>) Very
      good. But I wouldn't wear a bandeau on my hair if I were you, Pauline. I
      don't like these ribbons bound around the head of young girls. They make
      them look like pirates. (PAULINE <i>starts uneasily</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Pirates, mam? What a notion!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Pirates, or Italian ditch diggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE, (<i>boldly</i>) Well, mam, let it be pirates, then. Pirate is
      what I am. (<i>hesitates</i>) Grandma Gregg, you've always been good to
      me, barring the scrubbing and mopping and blacking shoes and stoves. If I
      was you, mam, I'd pack some clothes, so as to be ready for the sea voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Me? A sea voyage?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes'm. (<i>curtseys</i>) This Susan Jane Jones is not what she
      seems, mam. I let on, mam, I was of her way of thinking, mam, but I ain't.
      A husband is good enough woman's rights for me, mam. A nice, quiet,
      well-behaved husband like that one there is all I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. I don't understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Susan Jane Jones is a Militant Suffragette, mam.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. A Militant Suffragette? In this academy?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. Yes, mam. (<i>curtseys</i>) She's here like a snake in the grass,
      mam, and her and the young ladies is goin' to extinguish all the men.
      They're all goin' to be pirates, mam, and most bloody minded pirates they
      be, too. And you, mam, that never did them any harm, they are going to
      capture and take along with them in chains. For a chaperone, mam.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA, (<i>hanging her head</i>) And is this the reward for my efforts
      to make good wives of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter</i> SUSAN <i>cautiously. She beckons to the girls</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. This way! She's here!
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The girls creep in, knives in their teeth, swaggering like story-book
      pirates.</i> SUSAN <i>folds her arms.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Woman! Your hour has come!
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Well, I do declare!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. These poor maidens you thought to corrupt into housework ways, I
      have won from you. Here, to-day, the revolution that will sweep the men
      from the land and sea, begins! We are resolved! ALL. (<i>shouting</i>) We
      are resolved!
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. In these hearts burns nothing but hatred and detestation of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL. (<i>shouting</i>) Hatred and detestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. We don't want to have anything more to do with men.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. We are absolutely through with them. And with boys, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. Now, my dears&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Enough! Pirates, do your duty! Seize that man! (<i>two girls seize
      and bind the dummy</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Ha! Ha! Now seize and bind and gag that woman, (<i>points to</i>
      GRANDMA. <i>The girls rush at</i> GRANDMA, <i>who skips backward</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN, (<i>front, rubbing her hands with joy</i>) pirates! My faithful
      band of man-haters, (<i>to audience</i>) You men, your turn is next!
    </p>
    <p>
      A BOY'S VOICE. (<i>off stage</i>) OO-oo!
    </p>
    <p>
      (KATE, <i>who it about to bind</i> GRANDMA, <i>stops and listens</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE That's John!
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND BOY'S VOICE. (<i>off stage) Oo-oo! Oo-oo!</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. (<i>listening</i>) That's&mdash;that's Arthur!
    </p>
    <p>
      SEVERAL BOY'S VOICES. Oo-oo! Oo-Oo! Oo-oo!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDITH, IDA and Mat. That's Sam! That's George! That's Henry! (<i>all crowd
      to door and look out</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. (<i>eagerly</i>) Oh, girls! It's the boys, they want us to come out!
      Where's my hat?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>All rush in a crowd to sofa and begin digging wildly into wraps and
      hats, putting them on as hastily as possible</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Girls! Pirates! Stop! The revolution! Remember your cause!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATE. (<i>pinning on her hat</i>) Revolution! I haven't time for
      revolutions, don't you hear the boys calling us?
    </p>
    <p>
      SUSAN. Stop! Are you not women?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRACE. (<i>as all come forward</i>) Women? Pirates? Why no, we are just
      the I. I. Club. Just girls. Just sweet girls!
    </p>
    <p>
      VOICES, (<i>off stage</i>) Oo-oo!
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRLS. Oo-oo! Oo-oo! Oo-oo! (<i>they rush out</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      (SUSAN <i>slowly picks up umbrella and hand bag, and moves to door</i>.
      GRANDMA <i>takes up her knitting.</i> PAULINE <i>picks up her mop, and
      looks lovingly at dummy</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. I'm ashamed of you, sir. Why didn't you-oo at me when all them
      boys was oo-ooing? you had oo-ooed at me I would have oo-ooed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRANDMA. (<i>with interest</i>) Did he speak to you, Pauline?
    </p>
    <p>
      PAULINE. No, mam. He's an Ideal Husband, and Ideal Husbands don't talk
      back, mam.
